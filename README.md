# EveMarket
This is my first attempt at API usage (don't laugh). I could use any inputs I can get.

To achieve:

Attempt to pull Amarr market using Python requests - COMPLETE
Get a list of dicts with key:values indicating volume of items and items sold. - COMPLETE??
Ultimate goal is to find a way to get the daily volume of items from ESI. Items sold can be retrieved from history\'volume'.
Get script to loop all item_id values for a station's selling items.
Set script to accept user input allowing user to change the station to search.
